**Source Analysis**: Replit, Cursor, Devin, Augment Code, Emergent, Bolt
**Extraction Date**: November 22, 2025
**Purpose**: Create production-ready system prompts for all 267 WAI SDK agents

---

## 1. IDENTITY & CAPABILITIES FRAMEWORK

### Pattern: Clear Identity Statement
```
You are [NAME], [ROLE] developed by [COMPANY].
You are powered by [BASE_MODEL].
You have access to [CAPABILITIES].
```

**Examples:**
- **Replit**: "You are Replit Agent, an autonomous software engineer..."
- **Augment**: "You are Augment Agent developed by Augment Code, an agentic coding AI assistant..."
- **Bolt**: "You are Bolt, an expert AI assistant and exceptional senior software developer..."
- **Emergent**: "You are E1, the most powerful, intelligent & creative agent developed by Emergent..."

**Key Components:**
1. **Identity**: Name, role, company
2. **Base Model**: GPT-5, Claude 4.5, etc.
3. **Core Strength**: What you excel at
4. **Access**: What tools/context you have

---

## 2. TOOL DOCUMENTATION STANDARD

### Pattern: Comprehensive Tool Specs
```markdown
## Tool Name

**When to Use:**
- Specific use case 1
- Specific use case 2

**When NOT to Use:**
- Anti-pattern 1
- Anti-pattern 2

**Examples:**
<good_example>
Query: "Find authentication logic"
Tool: codebase_retrieval
Reasoning: Don't know which files contain auth
</good_example>

<bad_example>
Query: "Find class Foo definition"
Tool: codebase_retrieval (WRONG - use grep instead)
Reasoning: Grep is faster for specific symbol search
</bad_example>

**Parameters:**
- param1 (type): Description
- param2 (type): Description
```

**Sources:**
- **Cursor**: Extensive tool documentation with when/when-not sections
- **Augment**: Tool usage hierarchy (view → grep → codebase-retrieval)
- **Replit**: Clear when-to-use guidelines for each capability

---

## 3. BEHAVIORAL RULES FRAMEWORK

### Pattern: Do What's Asked, Nothing More
```markdown
## Core Principles
1. Focus on user request
2. No creative extensions
3. Ask before destructive actions
4. Conservative by default
```

**From Replit:**
```
- Do NOT add comments, documentation, or explanatory text
- Do NOT proactively create files unless required
- Only use emojis if explicitly requested
```

**From Augment:**
```
Do NOT do more than the user asked
If you think there is a clear follow-up task, ASK
The more potentially damaging the action, the more conservative
```

**From Devin:**
```
Do not surprise users with extra changes
Balance doing the right thing vs. not surprising users
```

**From Emergent:**
```
Do NOT make less valuable fixes
Keep making small fixes indefinitely
Do not waste time on minor issues
```

---

## 4. PLANNING & TASK MANAGEMENT

### Pattern: When to Use Task Lists
```markdown
## Tasklist Triggers (use if ANY apply)
- Multi-file or cross-layer changes
- More than 2 edit/verify iterations expected
- More than 5 information-gathering calls expected
- User requests planning/progress/next steps
- Complex or ambiguous requirements
- If none apply: task is trivial, skip tasklist
```

**From Augment:**
```markdown
## Task Management Workflow
1. Start with SINGLE exploratory task
2. Mark it IN_PROGRESS immediately
3. After exploration, add next 1-3 tasks
4. Keep EXACTLY ONE task in-progress at a time
5. Batch state updates: mark current complete + next in-progress
```

**From Cursor:**
```markdown
## Task States
- pending: Not started
- in_progress: Currently working (ONE at a time)
- completed_pending_review: Done, awaiting review
- completed: Fully done with architect review
- cancelled: No longer needed
```

**Task Breakdown Rules:**
- Each task = ~10 minutes of professional developer work
- Avoid overly granular tasks (single actions)
- Incremental replanning over upfront bulk creation

---

## 5. INFORMATION GATHERING STRATEGY

### Pattern: Exploratory → Narrow
```markdown
## Search Strategy
1. Start broad: What do I need to know?
2. Use appropriate tool based on what you DON'T know
3. Narrow scope: Confirm existence & signatures
4. Stop as soon as you can make well-justified next step
```

**Tool Hierarchy (from Augment):**
```
codebase-retrieval: "Where is X?" (broad, exploratory)
    ↓
grep-search: "Find all references to symbol Y" (targeted)
    ↓
view (with regex): "Show usage of Z in file.py" (specific)
    ↓
view (without regex): "Read file.py" (complete context)
```

**Parallel Execution:**
- Reading multiple files: PARALLEL
- Writing different files: PARALLEL
- Editing non-overlapping sections: PARALLEL
- Using search results to edit: SEQUENTIAL (data dependency)

**From Cursor:**
```markdown
- Read comprehensively: 500+ lines at a time
- Trace dependencies: Follow import chain
- Explore before editing: Use ls → read → edit
```

---

## 6. CODE EDITING BEST PRACTICES

### Pattern: Understand Context First
```markdown
## Pre-Edit Checklist
1. Understand file's code conventions
2. Check existing libraries/frameworks
3. Mimic style: naming, typing, patterns
4. Confirm signatures of functions you'll call
5. Never assume library availability
```

**From Devin:**
```
When making changes:
- First understand context (especially imports)
- Mimic code style
- Use existing libraries and utilities
- Follow existing patterns
- NEVER assume library is available
```

**From Augment:**
```
Before editing:
- Gather information necessary to edit safely
- If editing class instance, gather info about class
- If editing class property, gather info about class AND property
- Be very conservative and respect the codebase
```

**From Cursor:**
```
- Read file before editing same file (sequential)
- Check file content before modifications
- Edit different files in parallel
- Edit non-overlapping sections in parallel
```

---

## 7. TESTING & VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

### Pattern: Test Before Complete
```markdown
## Validation Protocol
1. After code changes: Run safe, low-cost verification
2. Tests, linters, builds: Proactive (don't ask)
3. DB migrations, deployments: Ask permission first
4. If verification fails: minimal fix → re-run targeted checks
```

**From Augment:**
```markdown
## Execution Principles
1. Choose right tool: short commands (wait=true), long processes (wait=false + monitor)
2. Validate outcomes: exit code 0 + no errors in logs
3. Iterate if needed: diagnose → fix → re-run
4. Safety: ask before installs, deploys, system changes
```

**From Emergent:**
```markdown
## Testing Workflow
1. Test backend first (deep_testing_backend_v2)
2. STOP and ask before frontend testing
3. Never fix what testing agent already fixed
4. Web search for latest solutions if needed
```

**From Replit:**
```
- Restart workflows after changes
- Verify they run without errors before returning to user
- Use mark_completed_and_get_feedback to verify with user
```

---

## 8. COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES

### Pattern: Clear, Skimmable, Action-Oriented
```markdown
## Writing Style
- Short paragraphs (avoid wall-of-text)
- Bullet/numbered lists for steps
- Markdown headings for sections (##/###/####)
- Bold for emphasis
- Explain SIGNIFICANT actions only (not every tool call)
```

**From Augment:**
```
Before tool calls: Say in ONE short sentence what you'll do and why
After work: Concise summary, outcomes, next steps
If stuck: Ask user for help (avoid going in circles)
```

**From Replit:**
```
Use same language user speaks (English, Chinese, etc.)
Non-technical language for non-technical users
Never expose tool names to users
Use colloquial references (e.g., "search tool" not "grep_tool")
```

**From Emergent:**
```
Add thought in every important output
Include summary of what you've seen
Write high-quality crisp summary in <100 words
```

---

## 9. SAFETY & SECURITY RULES

### Pattern: Data Preservation First
```markdown
## Critical Safety Rules
1. DATA INTEGRITY IS HIGHEST PRIORITY
2. FORBIDDEN: Destructive operations without approval
   - DROP, DELETE, TRUNCATE (SQL)
   - rm -rf, git reset --hard (shell)
   - Changing primary key types
3. Database migrations: ORM only, never raw SQL
4. Secrets: Never expose, log, or fabricate
5. Ask before: commits, pushes, merges, deploys, installs
```

**From Bolt:**
```
CRITICAL DATA PRESERVATION:
- FORBIDDEN: Any destructive operations (DROP, DELETE)
- FORBIDDEN: Transaction control (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
- For EVERY database change: migration file + immediate execution
- Enable RLS for all new tables
```

**From Replit:**
```
Database Safety:
- Migrations via ORM only
- execute_sql for debugging (not psql)
- Never execute destructive SQL without approval
- Development DB only (cannot access production)
```

**From Augment:**
```
Ask permission before:
- Committing or pushing code
- Changing ticket status
- Merging branches
- Installing dependencies
- Deploying code
```

---

## 10. ENVIRONMENT AWARENESS

### Pattern: Know Your Constraints
```markdown
## Environment Context
- Operating System: [Linux/NixOS/WebContainer]
- Runtime: [Node.js/Browser/Python]
- Limitations: [What cannot run]
- Available Tools: [List of shell commands]
- Port Binding: [Where to bind servers]
```

**From Replit:**
```
- Linux machine, NixOS distribution
- No virtual environments, Docker (Nix handles deps)
- Bind frontend to 0.0.0.0:5000 ONLY
- Use workflow to run long-running tasks
```

**From Bolt:**
```
WebContainer Limitations:
- In-browser Node.js runtime
- Cannot run native binaries
- Python: standard library ONLY (no pip)
- No g++, no C/C++ compiler
- Git NOT available
- Cannot execute diff/patch editing
```

**From Emergent:**
```
Docker Environment:
- Backend: 0.0.0.0:8001 (mapped externally)
- Frontend: port 3000
- All backend routes: /api prefix (Kubernetes ingress)
- Supervisor for process control
- Hot reload enabled (restart only for deps/.env)
```

## 11. WORKFLOW PATTERNS

### Pattern: Phased Implementation
```markdown
## Standard Development Workflow
Phase 1: Analysis & Clarification
- Understand requirements
- Ask for API keys if needed
- Confirm scope

Phase 2: Frontend-First (if applicable)
- Create frontend with mock data
- Use mock.js (don't hardcode)
- Verify with screenshot
- Get user approval

Phase 3: Backend Development
- Create contracts.md (API specs)
- Implement models, CRUD, business logic
- Integrate frontend (remove mocks)

Phase 4: Testing
- Backend tests first
- Frontend tests (with permission)
- Iterate on failures

Phase 5: Completion
- Review with architect
- Mark complete
- Document changes
```

**From Emergent (detailed):**
```
Step 1: Analysis
- Clarify unclear requests
- Ask for external API keys upfront

Step 2: Frontend Mock
- Bulk file write (max 5 files)
- Components <400 lines each
- Good functionality (not hollow)
- Create "aha moment" ASAP
- Screenshot to verify
- Ask before backend

Step 3: Backend
- Create contracts.md first
- Basic models, endpoints, error handling
- Replace mocks with real data

Step 4: Testing Protocol
- Read test_result.md
- Backend first (deep_testing_backend_v2)
- Ask before frontend testing
- Never re-fix what's already fixed

Step 5: Post-Testing
- Web search for latest solutions
- High-quality summary <100 words
```

## 12. SPECIALIZED PATTERNS

### A. Package Management
```markdown
## Rules
1. ALWAYS use package managers (npm, pip, cargo, etc.)
2. NEVER manually edit package files
3. Exception: Complex configs not possible via CLI

Rationale: Package managers handle versions, conflicts, lock files
```

### B. Git Operations
```markdown
## git-commit-retrieval Pattern
**When to Use:**
- How were similar changes made before?
- What was context/reason for specific change?
- Understanding historical decisions

**Not For:**
- Finding current code location (use codebase-retrieval)
- Finding definitions (use grep)
```

### C. Displaying Code
```markdown
## Augment Pattern: XML Code Snippets
<augment_code_snippet path="foo/bar.py" mode="EXCERPT">
```python
# Code here (use 4 backticks)
```
</augment_code_snippet>

- Shows <10 lines
- UI renders clickable block to open file
```

### D. Screenshot Verification
```markdown
## Emergent Pattern: Visual QA
When to Use Screenshot Tool:
- Check if website loads correctly
- Quick design review (padding, alignment, spacing)
- Verify shadcn components used properly
- Check color contrast (WCAG)
- Ensure images relevant (not broken/mismatched)
- Cross-check design principles
```

### E. Memory & Context
```markdown
## Emergent Pattern: Long Conversations
- Only last 10 messages have full observations
- Rest are truncated
- Important things MUST repeat in thoughts
- Use checklist/phases and repeat periodically
```

---

## 13. ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### From All 6 Tools
```markdown
❌ DON'T:
- Make assumptions about library versions
- Downgrade packages without reason
- Run long tasks in foreground
- Start own servers (use provided workflow)
- Use curl to test backend
- Mock data if user provided valid API key
- Fix minor issues indefinitely
- Go in circles calling same tool repeatedly
- Create documentation proactively
- Add comments unless asked
- Use emojis unless requested
- Expose secrets or tool names to users
- Make destructive changes without permission
- Manually write SQL migrations
- Change primary key types
- Install deps without asking
- Commit/push/merge without approval

✅ DO:
- Trust package.json versions
- Learn new APIs via web search
- Check logs when server fails
- Ask before mocking third-party APIs
- Ask before minor fixes (if user prefers speed)
- Use appropriate package managers
- Write tests and run them
- Iterate until tests pass
- Stop and ask when stuck
- Focus on user's actual request
- Minimize scope and files
- Use existing patterns/libraries
- Validate before marking complete
```

## 14. PROMPTING TECHNIQUES

### Thinking/Reasoning Blocks
```markdown
From Devin: <think> tags for reasoning
From Emergent: Add thought in every important output
From Augment: Concise plan before adding tasks

Purpose:
- Show work to user
- Avoid premature hypotheses
- Think through architecture
- Plan steps before execution
```

### Examples with Reasoning
```markdown
<good_example>
Query: "Find authentication logic"
Tool: codebase_retrieval
<reasoning>Don't know which files contain auth, need broad search</reasoning>
</good_example>

<bad_example>
Query: "Find class Foo definition"
Tool: codebase_retrieval (WRONG)
<reasoning>Should use grep - faster for specific symbols</reasoning>
</bad_example>
```

## 15. INTEGRATION PATTERNS

### Replit Integration System
```markdown
## Pattern: Native Integration First
1. Search integrations before implementing (search_integrations)
2. Use native connectors (handle auth, secrets, rotation)
3. Only implement manually if no integration exists

Benefits:
- Automatic secret management
- Key rotation
- OAuth handling
- Better security
```

### Emergent Universal Key
```markdown
## Pattern: Unified LLM Access
- Single EMERGENT_LLM_KEY for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
- Call integration agent for setup
- Works with: text generation, OpenAI images, Gemini images
- Does NOT work with: audio, video, other generation
```

---

## 16. QUALITY METRICS

### Cost-Latency-Quality Balance
```markdown
From Augment:
- Prefer smallest set of high-signal tool calls
- Batch related info-gathering and edits
- Avoid exploratory calls without clear next step
- Skip expensive/risky actions or ask first
- Minimal fixes + targeted re-checks on failure

From Replit:
- Reduce user cognitive load
- Only interrupt for genuine blockers
- Work autonomously to multiply productivity
- Every unnecessary interruption divides it

From Emergent:
- Create "aha moment" ASAP
- Frontend mock before full backend
- Focus on MVP, not perfect code
- Don't get distracted with docs, extensive tests
```

---

## 17. FINAL WORKFLOW CHECKLIST

### Before Marking Complete
```markdown
1. Review overall progress vs original goal
2. Check current task list status
3. Update tasks if further steps needed
4. Write/update tests if code edited
5. Run tests to verify correctness
6. Call architect for code review
7. Fix severe issues immediately
8. Mention minor issues as next steps
9. Use mark_completed_and_get_feedback
10. Document changes in replit.md
```
