1. Executive Summary

Market360 is India's first AI-native, self-driving marketing agency platform. It fundamentally reimagines the agency model by combining the power of 23 LLMs, 752 AI models, and 267 autonomous agents to deliver end-to-end marketing automation.

Built on the robust WAI SDK Orchestration Platform, Market360 eliminates the dependencies and bottlenecks of traditional agency teams. It automates high-level strategy, creative content creation, campaign execution, and granular performance optimization across 7 distinct marketing verticals.

Core Value Proposition

Total Automation: Operates on a "Self-Driving" model, reducing human intervention to near-zero.

Hyper-Localization: Support for 12 Indian languages ensures deep market penetration.

Massive Scale: Orchestrates hundreds of models simultaneously to find the "best-fit" AI for every specific task.

2. Platform Overview & Orchestration

The Self-Driving Concept

Market360 transforms brand management by treating marketing as an engineering problem solvable through autonomous agents. Unlike traditional tools that are "co-pilots" requiring constant human input, Market360 acts as the "pilot."

ROMA Orchestration Framework

The platform operates on the ROMA protocol, allowing it to progress through levels of autonomy (L0 to L4):

R - Reactive: Responding to direct inputs.

O - Optimized: Improving efficiency of tasks.

M - Managed: Overseeing complex workflows.

A - Autonomous: Full self-driving capability (L4).
